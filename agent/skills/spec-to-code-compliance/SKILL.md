# Requirements-to-code compliance

Check what the documents require against what the code enforces. A mismatch may need a code fix, a document correction, or clarification; do not assume the code is wrong merely because prose differs.

## Scope and authority

1. Identify the user-named documents, relevant implementation and intended version. Establish which documents are authoritative and distinguish mandatory requirements from recommendations, options, examples and future roadmap items. Resolve authority from evidence; ask only if a material conflict remains.
2. If there is no statement of intended behavior, report that prerequisite. Do not infer a requirement from code and then compare the code against itself. Use general code review instead when the user wants bug hunting without a specification.
3. This review is read-only. Report findings before any proposed implementation. Explicitly authorized small fixes can use the normal engineering workflow; a broad overhaul needs agreement on a target and boundaries first. Do not create report trees, tickets, rules, commits, tools or commands by default.

## Evidence-led comparison

1. Break the selected scope into individually checkable requirements. Record each requirement's source location, exact condition/strength, and the behavior that would satisfy or contradict it.
2. Trace actual execution paths: entry points, registrations, callers, enforcement, callees, persistence and error paths. Use LSP for available symbol intelligence. In services, authorization may live in route registration/middleware and uniqueness in a database constraint, not the handler.
3. Assign an evidence-backed outcome:
   - **Implemented:** enforcement establishes the required behavior on the inspected in-scope paths.
   - **Partial:** some reachable paths enforce it, while others do not.
   - **Contradicted:** the code produces behavior the requirement rules out.
   - **Stronger than specified:** an additional enforced restriction or invariant lacks documentation.
   - **Absent in searched scope:** no enforcement was found after the relevant paths and mechanisms were inspected; include search bounds and patterns.
   - **Undecidable:** ambiguity, missing code/configuration, unavailable evidence or unexamined paths prevent a conclusion.
4. For every potential gap, inspect plausible alternative enforcement before reporting it. A similarly named function is not evidence, a test assertion is not proof of runtime enforcement, and a failed text search is not proof of absence.
5. Look in the reverse direction too: note consequential behavior in the inspected code that the documents do not mention. This is a bounded observation, not a claim to have found every undocumented behavior.

## Coverage and consequence

Track every in-scope requirement as checked, partially checked or not checked. Identify unreadable documents and unverified paths. Use existing read-only scouts only for genuinely independent areas; large scope does not justify pretending one context inspected every call chain. Do not claim independent refutation unless it actually occurred, and do not add a compulsory second review loop.

Severity follows concrete impact and reachability, not wording similarity or the number of reviewers. A different mechanism that satisfies the requirement is not a behavior defect. An undocumented restriction can affect compatibility and is not automatically harmless. For uncertain consequences, state the missing precondition rather than inventing an attack or impact figure.

## Report

Lead with actionable discrepancies, then provide a compact requirement table: source, required behavior, outcome, enforcement/path evidence and uncertainty. Separate code defects, document drift, ambiguous requirements, and recommendations. Include checked/not-checked scope and actual checks performed. If there is no supported discrepancy, say so; do not manufacture one to fill a quota.

Do not execute checks merely because this skill is a review. Follow OMP's existing execution policy for any authorized check; on failure stop validation and automatic repair. Static reasoning, edits and runtime observations are different evidence.

## Completion

Every named requirement has an outcome or explicit coverage limitation, each reported discrepancy has source/path evidence and a defensible consequence, and the report does not promise the excluded upstream workflow's automation or coverage guarantees.
